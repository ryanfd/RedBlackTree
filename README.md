# RedBlackTree

This is implementation for a RedBlack Binary Search Tree for my Algorithms and Data Structures class in Computing Science.

Originally, this was separated into a header file containing a NodeT class and class declarations for the RedBlack tree. But due to submission requirements for the class, I moved all declaration and implementation into a single header file.

I also originally had a different repository for this assignment, but it got corrupted and after some time struggling to fix it, I decided to just create a new repository, hence the small number of commits in this repo.
